## üîç Introduction

Blockchain is a secure, decentralized ledger system that relies on consensus mechanisms to maintain integrity. The most widely used mechanism, **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**, involves solving cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions.

As embedded systems and IoT grow in importance, deploying blockchain consensus on such platforms is increasingly relevant. This project presents a **minimal, bare-metal PoW implementation** on the **STM32F412ZG** microcontroller.

## üéØ Objective

- Implement and demonstrate a simplified blockchain **PoW algorithm**.
- Use a **custom SHA-256** software hash function.
- Transmit mining results over **UART**.
- Evaluate performance and resource feasibility on embedded platforms.

## üìö Related Work

The implementation is inspired by:

> *Blockchain-Based Secure and Lightweight Authentication for Smart Home Applications in IoT Environment*  
> (Wiley, 2021)

This paper emphasized the need for **lightweight consensus** models on **edge devices**, aligning with our project goals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Overview

- **Input Data:** Static string (e.g., `"Hello STM32 Blockchain!"`)
- **Nonce:** 32-bit counter, incremented to satisfy the hash condition.
- **Hash Function:** Custom SHA-256 implementation.
- **Difficulty:** Number of leading zeros required in the hash.
- **Output:** Mined nonce + valid hash sent via UART.

The algorithm loops until it finds a hash with the desired number of leading zeros.

## üìà Performance Analysis

### Mining Time vs Difficulty

| Difficulty | Time to Mine     |
|------------|------------------|
| 1          | ~0.5 seconds     |
| 2          | ~5‚Äì8 seconds     |
| 3          | ~45‚Äì60 seconds   |
| 4          | ~1+ minute       |

Performance scales exponentially with difficulty due to the nature of PoW.
